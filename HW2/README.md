# HW2:  Integration

This project calculates the integral

\[
E(x) = \int(0 --> x)  e^{-t^2} dt
\]

## This program:
- Approximates \( e^x \) with a Taylor series  
- Uses the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration  
- Calculates \( E(x) \) for \( x = 0 \) to \( 3 \) (step 0.1)  
- Plots \( E(x) \) as a function of \( x \)  

## How to Run
python integration.py
