Fourier time series (TESS)

I load a TESS light curve and make a few plots:
raw light curve, Fourier spectrum (using Ari’s method), a gap filled version,
a reconstruction using only a few Fourier terms, a phase folded light curve, and a
spectral window of the sampling.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands:

light_curve
Plot brightness vs time. Just to see the data.

fourier
USing  Ari’s discrete Fourier transform on the densest chunk of data.
Shows a power vs index plot and prints the strongest peaks with their frequency and period.

fourier_interp
Same as fourier, but I first fill small missing time steps by straight line interpolation
on a uniform grid.

reconstruct --k K
Rebuilds the light curve using only the K strongest Fourier terms, then plot it against
the original to see how well a few terms capture the eclipses.

fold
Takes the best period from the Fourier result, fold the light curve to that period,
and overlay a binned median curve. If the period is right, the eclipses line up.

window
Plots the spectral window (the frequency content of the sampling itself).
I keep getting zero for all the coefficents.

How I did it:
1- I pick the densest block, make a uniform time grid using the median step,
mark grid points where we actually have data, run Ari’s transform on that mask,
and plot the mask’s power vs index. Keeps coming back to zero, not sure why.
