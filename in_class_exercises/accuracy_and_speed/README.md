**Numerical Physics Exercises**

Two small Python scripts exploring numerical behavior in basic physics problems.

---

**Quadratic Equation Solver**

Solves a quadratic equation using both the standard formula and a numerically stable alternative.  
Handles real and complex solutions.

**Purpose:** show floating-point roundoff and cancellation errors.

---

**Quantum Harmonic Oscillator**

Computes the average energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator using finite partial sums with different numbers of terms.

**Purpose:** show convergence behavior and why efficient numerical methods matter.

Both scripts run from the command line and are written for learning, not polish.
